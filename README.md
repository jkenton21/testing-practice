# testing-practice

This is a faily simple project meant just to practice testing using
jest. The goal is to use jest to test code for 5 different functions.

1. a function that takes a string and capitalizes the first character.

2. a function that takes a string and returns the reverse.

3. a simple calculator function that does addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. a caesarCipher function that takes a string and returns it with each character shifted.

5. an analyzeArray function that takes and array of numbers and returns an object with the average, min, max, and length.
